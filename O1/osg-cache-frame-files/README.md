# O1 Frame Files for OpenScienceGrid cache#

This directory contains the .cache files necessary for running on the open science grid. The cache file here gives the address to frame files that the workflow needs to use. FIXME, add more detail :-)

For more information on how to run the ```pycbc_make_coinc_workflow``` on OSG, consult http://ligo-cbc.github.io/pycbc/latest/html/workflow/pycbc_make_coinc_search_workflow.html?highlight=open%20science%20grid#running-on-the-open-science-grid .

# ER8 Gating Files

## Gating files for ER8B [1126051217, 1127271617)

Production gating files for ER8B:

 * H1-gating_C00_SNR300-1126051217-1220400.txt.gz
 * L1-gating_C00_SNR300-1126051217-1220400.txt.gz

The segments that were used to generate the triggers were generated by running the command [get_segments.sh](https://github.com/samantha-usman/gating/blob/master/omicron/segments/get_segments.sh)

### H1-gating_C00_SNR300-1126051217-1220400.txt.gz

Steps for generating the file:

 1. Make a ``logs`` and ``triggers`` directory.
 1. Build a frame file cache by running [find_h1_frames.sh](https://github.com/samantha-usman/gating/blob/master/omicron/H1/find_h1_frames.sh).
 1. Run the DAG [omicron.dag](https://github.com/samantha-usman/gating/blob/master/omicron/H1/omicron.dag) which uses the submit file [omicron.sub](https://github.com/samantha-usman/gating/blob/master/omicron/H1/omicron.sub) and the configuration file [parameters_0.txt](https://github.com/samantha-usman/gating/blob/master/omicron/H1/parameters_0.txt).
 1. To make the gating files, run [make_gates.sh](https://github.com/samantha-usman/gating/blob/master/omicron/H1/make_gates.sh)

The ``make_gates.sh`` script reports times for which you requested omicron triggers, but no triggers were output. For the current files, these are:

 * [1126910311 ... 1126910326) which corresponds to a lock too short to analyze. See [lock #4](https://ldas-jobs.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/~detchar/summary/day/20150921/lock/segments)

### L1-gating_C00_SNR300-1126051217-1220400.txt.gz

Steps for generating the file:

 1. Make a ``logs`` and ``triggers`` directory.
 1. Build a frame file cache by running [find_l1_frames.sh](https://github.com/samantha-usman/gating/blob/master/omicron/L1/find_l1_frames.sh).
 1. Run the DAG [omicron.dag](https://github.com/samantha-usman/gating/blob/master/omicron/L1/omicron.dag) which uses the submit file [omicron.sub](https://github.com/samantha-usman/gating/blob/master/omicron/L1/omicron.sub) and the configuration file [parameters_0.txt](https://github.com/samantha-usman/gating/blob/master/omicron/L1/parameters_0.txt).
 1. To make the gating files, run [make_gates.sh](https://github.com/samantha-usman/gating/blob/master/omicron/L1/make_gates.sh)

The ``make_gates.sh`` script reports times for which you requested omicron triggers, but no triggers were output. For the current files, these are:

 * [1126414893 ... 1126414951) lock too short to analyze [lock #1](https://ldas-jobs.ligo-la.caltech.edu/~detchar/summary/day/20150916/lock/segments/)
 * [1126555035 ... 1126555044) lock too short to analyze [lock #1](https://ldas-jobs.ligo-la.caltech.edu/~detchar/summary/day/20150917/lock/segments/)
 * [1126733175 ... 1126733223) lock too short to analyze [lock #5](https://ldas-jobs.ligo-la.caltech.edu/~detchar/summary/day/20150919/lock/segments/)
 * [1126771360 ... 1126771418) lock-loss bleeding into last omicron segment caused error message ``Otile::SaveTriggers: number of tiles above SNR threshold = 1002105 > 1000000 (L1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN) --> do not save segment 1126771360.00000-1126771418.00000``. These data have been CAT1 vetoed for the C00 run. A new CAT1 flag just containing the lock-loss time will be made for the C01 run and omicron re-run.

### H1

Some segments did not have omicron triggers (and thus gating vetoes) generated.
The following segments were too short to be analyzed:

 * [1127474051, 1127474278)
 * [1127480711, 1127480831)
The rest of the missing omicron triggers are due to problems at the end of a lockloss (which are CAT1 vetoed)

 * [1127814165, 1127814168)

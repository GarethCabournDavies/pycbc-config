# ER8 template banks

Here you can find scripts for building the uberbank for the combined offline
PyCBC search over ER8 as well as actual bank files.

## Description of banks provided here

#### H1L1-UBERBANK_MAXM100_NS0p05_ER7HMPSD-1000000000-50000

Bank constructed using the harmonic-mean ER7 PSD generated by Ian. The curve
can be found on Atlas at `~tito/er7/H1L1-ER7_HARM_MEAN_PSD-1116700672-1630208.txt`
and is plotted here:

The various steps of the construction of this bank are on Atlas under `~tito/er8/bank/*_ns0.05`.

#### H1L1-UBERBANK_MAXM100_NS0p05_ER8HMPSD-1126033217-223200

Bank constructed using the harmonic-mean ER8 PSD available in this repository
under `ER8/psd/H1L1-ER8_HARM_MEAN_PSD-1126033217-223200` and plotted here:

The various steps of the construction of this bank are on Atlas under `~tito/er8/bank/*_ns0.05_er8psd`.

## Building the bank

[Uberbank wiki page](https://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/ligovirgo/cbcnote/ER8/pycbc_offline/combined_bank#Construction)

## Validating the template bank

Refer to the [PyCBC documentation on verifying banks](http://ligo-cbc.github.io/pycbc/latest/html/uberbank_verify.html?highlight=verify).
Configuration files are already provided in `verification_banksims`, as well as
a shell script to make the process easier. Download the script, edit the paths
to the PSD and bank to verify, and run it. The banksim config files will be
downloaded and the banksims will be prepared automatically. Then just submit
the DAG to run the full set of banksims.

# ER8 average noise PSD estimates

Average single-detector and multi-detector noise PSDs from ER8.
The averaging uses the harmonic mean.

Files generated by the following runs:
 * **ER8_HARM_MEAN_PSD**: /home/tito/er8/psd_estimation_sep11_sep14 on Atlas
 * **ER8A_HARM_MEAN_PSD**: /home/dbrown/projects/aligo/er8/psd/psd-output-er8a on Sugar
 * **ER8B_HARM_MEAN_PSD**: /home/dbrown/projects/aligo/er8/psd/psd-output-er8b on Sugar

Use the Makefile for generating XML versions of the PSDs required for Sbank.
